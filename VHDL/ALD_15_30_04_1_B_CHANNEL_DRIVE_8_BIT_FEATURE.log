WARNING: During sheet edge merge, Logic block at 3B pin G outputs to two different signal names: +B B CH NOT 8 BIT vs. +S B CH NOT 8 BIT
WARNING: During sheet edge merge, Logic block at 3E pin A outputs to two different signal names: +B B CH 8 BIT vs. +S B CH 8 BIT
Removed 13 outputs from Gate at 3B to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 17 outputs from Gate at 3E to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 1 outputs from Dot Function at 5D to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Added LAMP signal LAMP_11C8G13
