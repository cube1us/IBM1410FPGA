Generating HDL for page 14.70.05.1 A RING 5 TIME at 9/2/2020 11:13:22 AM
DOT Function at 5H has one output from a Trigger, one output from Non-Trigger
   Trigger block pin B located at 5H, Non-trigger is located at 5I Output is to 4H
   Using Trigger faux pin T as input side of pin B
Processing extension from block at 5G (Database ID=243467) to 5H (Database ID=243468)
Copied connection to extension input pin E to master block at 5G
Copied connection to extension input pin A to master block at 5G
Copied connection to extension input pin P to master block at 5G
Copied connection to extension input pin T to master block at 5G
Copied connection from extension output pin B to master block at 5G
Copied mapped pin B from extension 5H to master block at 5G
Copied mapped pin K from extension 5H to master block at 5G
Copied mapped pin P from extension 5H to master block at 5G
Copied mapped pin T from extension 5H to master block at 5G
Moved connection from extension 5H pin B to be from master at 5G
Removed 4 outputs from Gate at 1D to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 1 outputs from Gate at 4G to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 1 outputs from Gate at 4H to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Added LAMP signal LAMP_15A1E04
