WARNING: During sheet edge merge, Logic block at 3B pin H outputs to two different signal names: +B B CH NOT A BIT vs. +S B CH NOT A BIT
WARNING: During sheet edge merge, Logic block at 3E pin C outputs to two different signal names: +B B CH A BIT vs. +S B CH A BIT
Removed 13 outputs from Gate at 3B to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 18 outputs from Gate at 3E to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 1 outputs from Dot Function at 5D to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Added LAMP signal LAMP_11C8F13
