DOT Function at 3C has one output from a Trigger, one output from Non-Trigger
   Trigger block pin B located at 3C, Non-trigger is located at 3A Output is to 2C
   Using Trigger faux pin T as input side of pin B
Processing extension from block at 3C (Database ID=192331) to 3D (Database ID=192333)
Copied connection to extension input pin K to master block at 3C
Copied connection to extension input pin H to master block at 3C
Copied connection from extension output pin F to master block at 3C
Copied mapped pin A from extension 3D to master block at 3C
Copied mapped pin E from extension 3D to master block at 3C
Copied mapped pin F from extension 3D to master block at 3C
Copied mapped pin X from extension 3D to master block at 3C
Moved connection from extension 3D pin F to be from master at 3C
Removed 1 outputs from Gate at 2C to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
