Generating HDL for page 17.13.06.1 EDIT CONTROLS at 10/8/2020 5:28:00 PM
No existing test bench file D:\Users\jay\Schematics\IBM1410\VHDL\ALD_17_13_06_1_EDIT_CONTROLS_tb.vhdl, generating default test bench code.
Note: DOT Function at 1C has input level(s) of S, and output level(s) of S, Logic Function set to OR
WARNING: During sheet edge merge, Logic block at 1A pin B outputs to two different signal names: -S SET DOLLAR SIGN vs. -S SET DOLLAR SIGN * EDIT
Removed 7 outputs from Gate at 1A to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
