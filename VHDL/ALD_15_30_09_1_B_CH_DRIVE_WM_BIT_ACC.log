Processing extension from block at 3A (Database ID=247191) to 3B (Database ID=247192)
Removed 14 outputs from Gate at 3A to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Generating Statement for block at 3A with output pin(s) of OUT_3A_C
	and inputs of MS_B_DATA_REG_WM_BIT
	and logic function of Special
Generating output sheet edge signal assignment to 
	signal PS_B_CH_WM_BIT_1
	from gate output OUT_3A_C
