Generating HDL for page 14.71.36.1 F AR READOUT-ACC at 9/7/2020 11:00:15 AM
No existing test bench file D:\Users\jay\Schematics\IBM1410\VHDL\ALD_14_71_36_1_F_AR_READOUT_ACC_tb.vhdl, generating default test bench code.
Removed 4 outputs from Gate at 1B to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Generating Statement for block at 5B with output pin(s) of OUT_5B_E
	and inputs of PS_F_CYCLE_CTRL,PS_F_CH_OVLP_IN_PROCESS,MS_CONSOLE_INHIBIT_AR_RO
	and logic function of NAND
Generating Statement for block at 2B with output pin(s) of OUT_2B_E
	and inputs of OUT_5B_E,MV_CE_RO_F_AR,OUT_3C_D
	and logic function of NAND
Generating Statement for block at 1B with output pin(s) of OUT_1B_C
	and inputs of OUT_2B_E
	and logic function of EQUAL
Generating Statement for block at 3C with output pin(s) of OUT_3C_D
	and inputs of PS_STORE_ADDR_REG_OPS_RO_GATE,PS_F_SYMBOL_OP_MODIFIER
	and logic function of NAND
Generating output sheet edge signal assignment to 
	signal PS_RO_F_AR
	from gate output OUT_1B_C
