No existing test bench file D:\Users\jay\Schematics\IBM1410\VHDL\ALD_39_10_01_1_MEMORY_CLK_READ_CYCLE_FEAT_ACC_tb.vhdl, generating default test bench code.
NOTE: Special signal LOGIC ONE removed from sheet inputs list.
WARNING: Diagram block at coordinate 3B has 2 different output pins: A,Q
WARNING: Diagram block at coordinate 5F has 2 different output pins: A,Q
WARNING: Diagram block at coordinate 5I has 2 different output pins: A,Q
Note: DOT Function at 5F has input level(s) of Y, and output level(s) of S, Logic Function set to OR
DOT Function at 5F has one output from a Trigger, one output from Non-Trigger
   Trigger block pin Q located at 5F, Non-trigger is located at 5G Output is to 3F
   Using Trigger faux pin 7 as input side of pin Q
