Note: DOT Function at 1B has input level(s) of S, and output level(s) of S, Logic Function set to OR
Note: DOT Function at 5C has input level(s) of S, and output level(s) of S, Logic Function set to OR
Notes indicated to force a  D FF at output of gate at 3B
Notes indicated to force a  D FF at output of gate at 4C
Removed 8 outputs from Dot Function at 1B to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Added LAMP signal LAMP_11C8E14
