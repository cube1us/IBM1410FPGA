Old test bench file ALD_11_10_10_1_LOGIC_GATE_RING_A_ACC_tb.vhdl 50 lines preserved and 0 declaration lines preserved
DOT Function at 4C has one output from a Trigger, one output from Non-Trigger
   Trigger block pin F located at 4C, Non-trigger is located at 3F Output is to 3C
   Using Trigger faux pin X as input side of pin F

Copied connection to extension input pin K to master block at 4B
Copied connection to extension input pin H to master block at 4B
Copied connection to extension input pin X to master block at 4B
Copied connection from extension output pin F to master block at 4B
Copied mapped pin A from extension 4C to master block at 4B
Copied mapped pin E from extension 4C to master block at 4B
Copied mapped pin F from extension 4C to master block at 4B
Copied mapped pin X from extension 4C to master block at 4B
Moved connection from extension 4C pin F to be from master at 4B
Removed 4 outputs from Gate at 1C to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 7 outputs from Gate at 1E to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Added LAMP signal LAMP_15A1A06
