Ignoring Logic Block 5F with symbol R
Processing extension from block at 3B (Database ID=246174) to 3C (Database ID=246175)
Processing extension from block at 3E (Database ID=246178) to 3F (Database ID=246179)
WARNING: During sheet edge merge, Logic block at 3B pin H outputs to two different signal names: +B B CH NOT 2 BIT vs. +S B CH NOT 2 BIT
WARNING: During sheet edge merge, Logic block at 3E pin C outputs to two different signal names: +B B CH 2 BIT vs. +S B CH 2 BIT
Removed 13 outputs from Gate at 3B to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 16 outputs from Gate at 3E to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 1 outputs from Dot Function at 5D to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Added LAMP signal LAMP_11C8J13
