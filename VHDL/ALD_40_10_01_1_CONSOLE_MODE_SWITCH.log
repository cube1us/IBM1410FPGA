WARNING: Diagram block at coordinate 5C has 5 different output pins: A,B,K,D,E
WARNING: Diagram block at coordinate 5D has 7 different output pins: F,G,H,J,L,M,N
Block at coordinate 5E is marked for No HDL Generation -- skipped.
Note: DOT Function at 5D has input level(s) of , and output level(s) of , Logic Function set to OR
NOTE: DOT Function at 5D is fed only by rotary switch(es) and/or resistors an/or -C inputs. Changing logic function to AND
