WARNING: During sheet edge merge, Logic block at 5A pin N outputs to two different signal names: +S DENSITY SW 800+556 CH 1 vs. +S DENSITY SW 556+200 CH 1
WARNING: During sheet edge merge, Logic block at 5B pin N outputs to two different signal names: +S DENSITY SW 800+556 CH 2 vs. +S DENSITY SW 556+200 CH 2
