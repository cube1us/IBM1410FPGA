Ignoring Logic Block 5F with symbol R
Processing extension from block at 3B (Database ID=246360) to 3C (Database ID=246361)
Processing extension from block at 3E (Database ID=246365) to 3F (Database ID=246366)
WARNING: During sheet edge merge, Logic block at 3B pin E outputs to two different signal names: +B B CH NOT 4 BIT vs. +S B CH NOT 4 BIT
WARNING: During sheet edge merge, Logic block at 3E pin H outputs to two different signal names: +B B CH 4 BIT vs. +S B CH 4 BIT
Removed 13 outputs from Gate at 3B to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 15 outputs from Gate at 3E to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 1 outputs from Dot Function at 5D to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Added LAMP signal LAMP_11C8H13
