Ignoring Logic Block 5F with symbol R
WARNING: During sheet edge merge, Logic block at 3E pin A outputs to two different signal names: +B B CH C BIT vs. +S B CH C BIT
Removed 3 outputs from Gate at 3B to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 3 outputs from Gate at 3E to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 1 outputs from Dot Function at 5D to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Added LAMP signal LAMP_11C8D13
