Old test bench file ALD_11_10_16_1_LOGIC_GATE_RING_G_ACC_tb.vhdl 50 lines preserved and 0 declaration lines preserved
DOT Function at 4C has one output from a Trigger, one output from Non-Trigger
   Trigger block pin B located at 4C, Non-trigger is located at 4E Output is to 3C
   Using Trigger faux pin T as input side of pin B
Processing extension from block at 4B (Database ID=188897) to 4C (Database ID=188898)
Copied connection to extension input pin E to master block at 4B
Copied connection to extension input pin A to master block at 4B
Copied connection to extension input pin P to master block at 4B
Copied connection to extension input pin T to master block at 4B
Copied connection from extension output pin B to master block at 4B
Copied mapped pin B from extension 4C to master block at 4B
Copied mapped pin K from extension 4C to master block at 4B
Copied mapped pin P from extension 4C to master block at 4B
Copied mapped pin T from extension 4C to master block at 4B
Moved connection from extension 4C pin B to be from master at 4B
Removed 1 outputs from Gate at 3B to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Removed 1 outputs from Gate at 3C to ignored block(s) or identical signal names
Added LAMP signal LAMP_15A1G06
